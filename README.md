# Self_Assessment
An assessment of the class project.

## Self-Assessment

Over the course of the project I took on multiple roles, from database development to coding for data processing and visualizations, as well as documentation, clean-up, and peer reviews.  I would take time to review the work others did and leave questions in comments or work through Zoom sessions live to discuss what changes were worked on.

The greatest personal challenge for me through this project was a personal loss.  Our family lost our first ever pet, our cat, to acute kidney failure a few weeks ago.  We were all heartbroken and we are still grieving, though we are doing much better.  I am forever thankful to my team for being their to support me, to allow me the space to grieve while they picked up on work that I had been doing, keeping me included and caught up with project details, and helping me get back into the swing of things.  

## Team Assessment

My team was fantastic!  We spent a lot of time primarily on Zoom working through all the parts of the project together and communicating via Slack outside of those times.  We did have a few challenges in communication schedules thanks to prior work and family commitments, but we were able to overcome those by having small side-meetings to keep everyone in the loop and update with how we had progressed on our various tasks.

One of the greatest strengths of our team was not being afraid to communicate.  We spent a lot of time talking to each other, sending messages, asking each other questions, and helping each other out so no one member would fall behind or be left confused.  If anyone else were to work on this project I would highly suggest to keep all of those communication lines open and not be afraid to ask for help.  

One of our teammates (Kim) said she was willing to bet on our team, and I agree with her - we had a great working relationship and I think given how challenging our project was and how we had to face some life-relate frustrations we still did well. 

## Summary of Project 

Our project focuses on the relationship of a company's stock performance to the geographic location of that company's home office or headquarters.  We collected top 100 performing NASDAQ company data from different sources and used two types of models for training and testing (Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Decision Trees).  Ultimately our results proved inconclusive based on the scores we were getting.  With a little more time and some experimentation with our chosen features or chosen models, we could probably generate higher quality predictions and answer our questions.
